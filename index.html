                I am going to write this for the purpose of introducing myself to my instructors and peers, rather than for the purpose of a professional portfolio page, as I will be making another one when I learn more. With that being said, my coding journey starts junior year of highschool. During this time I was enrolled in a web development class with an excellent instructor and mentor. I planned on pursing a cybersecurity career in the military after highschool, but this changed after descending into an absolutely crippling depression. I couldn't stay awake, I was constantly wracked with an anxiety which I could feel pulsating in my gut, walking up stairs exhausted me, I had no motivation to pursue anything at all, and I was generally in a state of meaningless and never-ending agony during every waking moment. I was able to dig myself out of this after six months of constant study of philosophy, neurochemistry, religion, and depression. But I was still not at an optimal state, having picked up many bad coping habits such as smoking and a general attachment to physical pleasure of any kind. I also had lost confidence in my own intelligence and ability, which had once been very high. I started working at a tree service after I graduated, and spent a year working sixty to ninety hour weeks doing some of the most physically intensive labor one can do. My boss and I became very close, and he served as a mentor for me, encouraging me to take pride in my work, better myself, and generally instructed me in how to be an exceptional young man. The sheer difficulty of the work I endured help restore some of my confidence, and it placed me in better physical health than I had been in years. I started to remember how much I enjoyed coding and my dream of making money from a computer. I quit my job soon after and enrolled in Lamda School, hoping to accomplish that dream. Now I am in better health than I ever have been, I have quit smoking and all other sources of cheap pleasure. Now I read, work, and exersise, and that is it. Although my confidence in myself has never quite reached what it was when I was younger, I hope that completing this school and landing a job will restore some of that lost sense of satisfaction in who I am. And in regard to what triggered the depression, nihilism is responsible. It was a theological issue.
